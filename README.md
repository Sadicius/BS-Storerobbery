## With the BS-Storerobbery script you can make the shops you want to be robbed.

### There is an NPC inside the shop. This NPC will leave the shop or walk away from the cash register at certain intervals. If the NPC sees you robbing the shop, the NPC will attack you.

### A random item will appear in the area you rob. All settings can be made easily via config
